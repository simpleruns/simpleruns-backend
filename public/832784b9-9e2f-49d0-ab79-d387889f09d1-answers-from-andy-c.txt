1. Something simple, really?
WordPress is a tool that helps you create a website without needing to know how to code. It's like having a magic wand that you can use to build your own website, just by clicking and typing with no coding knowledge.

Think of it like building a house. You don't need to be an architect or a builder to create a home. You just need the right tools and materials. WordPress is like the toolbox that helps you build your website.

Now, a plugin is like a special tool that you can add to your toolbox to make your website even better. It's like adding a power drill to your toolbox to make it easier to put up shelves.

For example, if you want to add a contact form to your website, you can use a plugin that will help you create one without needing to know how to code. It's like having a special tool that helps you build a specific part of your website.

Overall, WordPress is important because it makes it easy for anyone to create a website, even if they don't have any technical skills. And plugins make it even easier to add special features to your website, without needing to know how to code.


2.How’s your code?


I can do this function by modifying functions.php file in my theme directory.
Below is the codes for it.

// Add phone number field to user profile
function add_phone_number_field( $user ) {
?>
    <h2><?php _e('Phone Number'); ?></h2>
    <table class="form-table">
        <tr>
            <th><label for="phone_number"><?php _e('Phone Number'); ?></label></th>
            <td>
                <input type="text" name="phone_number" id="phone_number" value="<?php echo esc_attr( get_the_author_meta( 'phone_number', $user->ID ) ); ?>" class="regular-text" /><br />
                <span class="description"><?php _e('Please enter your phone number.'); ?></span>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
<?php
}
add_action( 'show_user_profile', 'add_phone_number_field' );
add_action( 'edit_user_profile', 'add_phone_number_field' );

// Save phone number field
function save_phone_number_field( $user_id ) {
    if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_user', $user_id ) ) { 
        return false; 
    }
    update_user_meta( $user_id, 'phone_number', $_POST['phone_number'] );
}
add_action( 'personal_options_update', 'save_phone_number_field' );
add_action( 'edit_user_profile_update', 'save_phone_number_field' );


After saving file, you can see phone number field in the user profile page after refreshment.


3. Need for Speed


1)Optimize images:
Your sites image size is 1500x1000 and it is too big for now. Use smaller one. And compress your images to reduce their file size without compromising on quality using tools like TinyPNG or Compressor.io to do this.
2)Minimize HTTP requests:
You imported almost 20 js files and they are many unuseful js files for your sites. Remove then and combine all js files if possible.
3)Minimize render blocking resources.
Optimize your CSS and JavaScript files to reduce the first loading time.
You can use critical css generator and js minimize tools.
4)And use proper keywords for SEO.
This site doesn’t have meta description and we can improve site SEO by inserting it.
There are many possiblities to improve site performance in your sites.
You can use proper image sizes match to your mobile and remove unused js files. Also avoid to use document.write() function to affect to your site speed.
5)Finally, you can use CDN or fast web hosting service and enable browser caching for page speed optimization.


4. Multisites lock the world


Yes, it is possible to change subdomain to a custom one. You can follow these steps.

1)You should purchase new domain named company.com
2)Login your multisite network as super admin.
3)Go to network admin dashboard and click on sites.
4)Select the subsite you want to change (company.mysite.com) and click the edit button.
5)In the site address field, replace ‘company.mysite.com’ with ‘company.com’. And click on save button.
6)Login your domain register account and setup DNS record for new domain name (company.com) to the point to the IP address of your WordPress Multisite network.
7)Wait the DNS changes for the few hours.
8)Done! It will works properly. Cheers.


5. Some styles please.


First, we should remove site title tag from view. 
We can use display: none for it.
.wp-block-site-title {
 display: none;
}


Second, we should exchange background color of header. Since it is declared as important we must use important declaration for overiding style.
.has-foreground-background-color {
    background-color: #6fabac !important;
}


Third, we should set background color and text color of top navigation menu.
body .is-layout-flex .wp-block-navigation__responsive-container {
  background-color: #fff !important;
  padding: 12px 10px;
  color: #6fabac !important;
}


Fourth, we should work on header search form for removing search form label, removing border radius, search button background color change.
header .wp-block-search__label {
  display: none;
}
header .wp-block-search__inside-wrapper > * {
  border-radius: 0;
}
header .wp-block-search__button {
    background-color: #cb5000 !important;
}


Here you can remove has-secondary-background-color class from the button and set background color without important declaration.
Fiveth, you should add margin bottom of search form for the design matching. 
body .is-layout-constrained > * + * {
    margin-block-end: 1.5rem;
}


Sixth, we are missing wp logo at the top of page.
We can insert image tag and select image or just can do it using css.
header .wp-block-navigation::before {
   content: ‘’;
   display: block;
   position: relative;
   background-image: ‘imgURL’;
   width: 100px;
   height: 100px;
   right: 50%;
   transform: translateX(50%);
}

Until now we finised work on header.
Seventh, we will work on main section
.wp-site-blocks > * + * {
  margin-block-start: 0;
  padding-left: 4rem;
  padding-right: 4rem;
  Padding-bottom: 4rem;
} /* Remove space between header and main section and set left and right padding */
.wp-block-post-featured-image img {
    border-radius: 10px;
} /* Set border radius to all post featured images. */
.is-layout-flow a {
  color: #6fabac;
} /* Set post title’s text color. */


Finanlly, we will work on footer section
footer p.wp-block-site-title a {
    color: #aa5515;
} /* Set footer’s site title color */
Footer.has-link-color a {
  color: #6fabac;
}  /* Set footer’s link color */
